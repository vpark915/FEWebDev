## Documentation
For this I used the nodeJS framework along with firebase for backend functions and a server-side .env file for security. The hardest part of this was getting started because when creating a backend system it feels overwhelming to get started. Once I got started though it became easier but making typos and addressing arrays incorrectly was really hard. In the end I was able to create a backend system that could support multiple accounts along with creating basic sign up features.
