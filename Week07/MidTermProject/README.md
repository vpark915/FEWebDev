## Midterm Documentation
Initially it was tough to figure out exactly how the system of html worked. I know that we did a bunch of examples in class but I don't think my mind quite understood the dynamics between divs and flex. But, after a while, I reached a flow and finally figured out how divs formatted especially with the display and position property. The media query was fairly simple as I really only needed to change the flex direction to column so it would better fit. The hardest part was changing bad code after I had already made a bunch of progress with a better div system. Going back to change code was absolutely grueling.
